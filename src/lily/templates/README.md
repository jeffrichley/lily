# Documentation

This directory contains project documentation artifacts managed by Lily.

## Purpose

The `.lily/docs/` folder contains structured documentation that guides the project development process. Each document serves a specific purpose in the project lifecycle:

- **VISION.md**: Defines what the project is, why it exists, and who it serves
- **GOALS.md**: Lists primary objectives and success criteria
- **NON_GOALS.md**: Clarifies what is explicitly out of scope
- **CONSTRAINTS.md**: Documents technical, business, and time constraints
- **ASSUMPTIONS.md**: Records assumptions about technology, users, and business context
- **OPEN_QUESTIONS.md**: Tracks questions that need answers before proceeding

These documents are living artifacts that should be updated as the project evolves. They provide context for decision-making and help maintain focus on project goals.

## Structure

Each document follows a consistent structure with section headers, guidance comments (in HTML comments), and bullet lists for content. Fill in the bullet lists with relevant information as you work through the project phases.

## Note

This directory is located in `.lily/docs/` to avoid conflicts with project-specific documentation that may be stored in a `docs/` folder at the project root.
