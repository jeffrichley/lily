### User

given that we have these docs, what is the next step to do?

---

### Assistant

Alright. I’m going to be very precise here.

Given what you’ve already written:

LILY_AGENT_MODE_V0.md (scope)

LILY_AGENT_MODE_V0

lily_agent_mode_behaviors.md (runtime contract)

lily_agent_mode_behaviors

skills_loader_contract.md (discovery + precedence + snapshot)

skills_loader_contract

SKILL_SPEC_V0.md (skill format)

SKILL_SPEC_V0

SESSION_MODEL_V0.md (session state model)

SESSION_MODEL_V0

commands_v0.md (deterministic command surface)

commands_v0

You are no longer in “design the spec” mode.

You are in “prove the contracts are coherent” mode.

The Next Step 👉 Implement the Smallest Vertical Slice

Not all of Lily.

Not all commands.

Not all skills.

One complete, end-to-end slice:

Load → Snapshot → /skills → /skill → Execute one skill.

If that works, the entire architecture holds.

If it doesn’t, your contracts are wrong — and it’s better to find that now.

What That Vertical Slice Includes 1️⃣ Implement the Skills Loader (Minimal, Real)

From skills_loader_contract.md

skills_loader_contract

:

Two roots only:

Bundled

Workspace

Deterministic precedence

Deterministic alphabetical ordering

Eligibility filtering

Build snapshot object

No reload yet. No watchers. No user root if you want to defer it.

Just:

python Copy code snapshot = build_skill_snapshot()

That’s it.

2️⃣ Implement Session Bootstrap

From SESSION_MODEL_V0.md

SESSION_MODEL_V0

:

Create:

python Copy code Session(
    session_id=...,
    active_agent="default",
    skill_snapshot=snapshot,
    model_config=...,
    conversation_state=[]
)

You now have:

Snapshot stability

A container for commands to operate on

Deterministic command resolution boundary

Still no LLM logic needed.

3️⃣ Implement Two Commands Only

From commands_v0.md

commands_v0

:

Implement only:

/skills

/skill <name>

Not /agent Not /reload_skills Not /help

Minimal surface.

This proves:

Snapshot is real

Deterministic resolution works

Skill name matching is exact

No fallback

4️⃣ Create One First-Party Skill

From SKILL_SPEC_V0.md

SKILL_SPEC_V0

:

Create a single bundled skill:

bash Copy code skills/ └── echo/
    └── SKILL.md

Make it prompt_rewrite.

Something dead simple:

“When invoked, respond by echoing the user request in uppercase.”

No tools. No filesystem. No complexity.

If /skill echo works deterministically, your entire skill pipeline works.

Why This Is the Correct Next Step

Right now you have:

Clean contracts

Clear boundaries

Deterministic rules

Strong anti-drift guarantees

But you have not yet tested:

Whether these contracts compose cleanly in code

Whether any circular dependency exists

Whether skill selection + session snapshot + command dispatch create edge-case leaks

This vertical slice will expose:

Loader mistakes

Snapshot drift mistakes

Command parsing bugs

Spec ambiguity

Before the system gets big.

What You Should Not Do Next

Do not:

Add more commands

Add user root

Add tool policy enforcement

Add multiple agents

Add model switching

Add dynamic persona reload

Add reload watchers

Add CI checks

Add plugin packs

That’s surface expansion.

You haven’t validated the core yet.

Definition of “Slice Complete”

You are done with this step when:

build_skill_snapshot() produces deterministic output

Session stores it

/skills lists snapshot exactly

/skill echo invokes only echo

No fallback happens

Snapshot remains stable even if filesystem changes mid-session

If that works, you have proven:

Lily Agent Mode V0 is structurally sound.

And then — and only then — we add reload.

If you want, next message I can give you:

The exact file structure

The minimal Python module layout

The clean execution flow diagram

Or the 10-step implementation checklist you can hand to Lily-the-coder

Your move.

### User

is a session llm backed?

---

### Assistant

Short answer?

No. A session is not LLM-backed.

It contains an LLM configuration and conversation history — but the session itself is a deterministic state container.

Let me explain carefully, because this boundary matters a lot for Lily.

What a Session Actually Is (Per Your Spec)

From SESSION_MODEL_V0.md

SESSION_MODEL_V0

, a session stores:

session_id

active_agent

skill_snapshot

model_config

conversation_state

None of those require an LLM to exist.

They are just structured state.

The LLM is a consumer of session state, not the owner of it.

The Correct Mental Model

Think of it like this:

scss Copy code Session ├── skill_snapshot  (deterministic) ├── active_agent    (deterministic) ├── model_config    (deterministic) └── conversation_state (history)

Then:

scss Copy code LLM(session_state) → response

The LLM is invoked with session state.

The session is not powered by the LLM.

Why This Matters (A Lot)

If the session were “LLM-backed”:

Skill availability could drift

Command resolution could become probabilistic

Persona injection could mutate implicitly

Deterministic overrides would collapse

But your contracts explicitly forbid that.

From lily_agent_mode_behaviors.md

lily_agent_mode_behaviors

:

Commands must not rely on probabilistic routing.

That means the session must remain independent of LLM behavior.

What Is LLM-Backed?

Only this:

Conversational skill selection

Skill execution in prompt_rewrite mode

Natural language responses

Everything else is deterministic infrastructure.

The Clean Boundary

Here is the clean layering Lily should maintain:

yaml Copy code Layer 0: Filesystem (skills) Layer 1: Loader (deterministic) Layer 2: Session (deterministic container) Layer 3: Command parser (deterministic) Layer 4: Skill invocation logic (mixed) Layer 5: LLM reasoning (probabilistic)

The session lives in Layer 2.

It must not depend on Layer 5.

If You Want the One-Line Rule

A session is:

A deterministic execution context that an LLM may use — but never control.

That separation is what gives you replayability later.

And that’s something OpenClaw does not cleanly enforce.

If you'd like, next we can talk about:

Whether session state should be serializable

Whether model_config belongs inside session or outside

Or how to make sessions replayable without building a full execution graph yet

---

### User

oh so the session has info to push into the llm prompts and the like?

---

### Assistant

Yes. Exactly.

A session is the structured state that gets assembled into the LLM call.

But it is not itself the LLM.

Think of It Like This

The session stores:

active_agent

persona content (from SOUL / IDENTITY / USER / AGENTS)

skill_snapshot

model_config

conversation_state

When you call the LLM, you build a prompt like:

csharp Copy code SYSTEM: [persona content] [skill instructions if selected]

MESSAGES: [conversation_state...]

The session provides all the ingredients.

The LLM just consumes the assembled context.

Clean Separation

Session = state container

Prompt builder = assembler

LLM = reasoning engine

If you blur those, determinism collapses.

What Actually Gets “Pushed” Into the LLM

From the session:

1. Persona content

Loaded once at session start. Stable for the entire session (per your contract).

2. Conversation history

Ordered list of prior turns. Must preserve role order.

3. Skill instructions (if selected)

Injected only for that turn. Not permanently appended unless you design it that way.

4. Model config

Temperature, reasoning level, etc. Controls how the LLM behaves.

What Does Not Go Into the LLM

Entire skill index

Filesystem state

Raw loader diagnostics

Snapshot metadata

Tool policy enforcement logic

Those stay outside.

The LLM should not “see” infrastructure.

Why This Matters For Lily

You want:

Deterministic commands

Snapshot stability

No mid-session drift

Replayability

That only works if:

The session remains an authoritative data structure, and the LLM is just a stateless computation step.

Subtle But Important

The session doesn’t “push into the LLM” automatically.

The runtime does this:

ini Copy code prompt = assemble(session_state) response = call_llm(prompt, session.model_config)

The session never calls the LLM itself.

That boundary is what keeps Lily clean and composable.

If you want, next we can map:

Exactly what the prompt assembly pipeline should look like

Or how to make it replayable later without a full IR/compiler layer

Or whether persona should be precompiled into a single system block per session

Your call.

### User

ok, you gave 4 things to work through. lets do The exact file structure

---

### Assistant

Cool. Here’s the exact file structure for the minimal vertical slice (Load → Snapshot → /skills → /skill → run one skill).

This is intentionally small, boring, and shippable.

What each directory means skills/

Bundled skills shipped with Lily (your “first-party”). This is SKILLS_BUNDLED_DIR per loader contract.

skills_loader_contract

workspace/skills/

Project-local skills and overrides. This is SKILLS_WORKSPACE_DIR.

skills_loader_contract

(You can point it somewhere else later; for now it’s just a simple demo folder.)

src/lily/skills/*

The loader + parsing code that implements SKILL_SPEC_V0.md and skills_loader_contract.md.

SKILL_SPEC_V0

skills_loader_contract

src/lily/commands/*

Only the deterministic commands you said are non-negotiable for v0.

commands_v0

For the slice, we implement only /skills and /skill <name>.

The one bundled skill we start with text Copy code skills/echo/SKILL.md

It should include optional frontmatter and a dead-simple body, something like:

summary: ...

invocation_mode: prompt_rewrite

optionally command: echo

(Exactly as allowed by SKILL_SPEC_V0.md.)

SKILL_SPEC_V0

Minimal “runtime contract” wiring

cli.py creates a Session (which includes the snapshot)

SESSION_MODEL_V0

cli.py routes:

if input starts with / → command parser (no LLM)

commands_v0

else → conversational mode (can be stubbed for now)

If you want the next move, I can give you the exact module responsibilities + function signatures (so Lily-the-coder can implement without inventing APIs).

### User

- i feel like the packages need to be reworked some. each major component of this system needs to have its own package. 
- we should list out the major modules and their responsibilities
- we also need to do the clean execution flow

---

### Assistant

Yep — you’re right. If each major component is real, it deserves its own package boundary. Here’s a clean cut that matches your contracts and keeps the “kernel” feel.

Major packages and responsibilities (V0) lily_session/

Owns: session state as a deterministic container. Contains:

Session model (active_agent, skill_snapshot, model_config, conversation_state)

session lifecycle helpers: new_session(), apply_command_result()

(optional) session serialization later

lily_persona/

Owns: persona bootstrap from files. Contains:

loader for SOUL.md, IDENTITY.md, USER.md, AGENTS.md

PersonaBundle (the assembled system-context text blocks)

“read once per session” semantics (v0)

lily_skills/

Owns: everything about skills except “LLM reasoning.” Contains:

skill format parsing (frontmatter + body) per SKILL_SPEC_V0

loader/discovery/precedence/eligibility per skills_loader_contract

snapshot construction: SkillSnapshot

types: SkillEntry, InvocationMode, EligibilityResult, diagnostics

lily_commands/

Owns: deterministic command surface. Contains:

/ parser (exact-match, no fuzzy)

command handlers:

/skills

/skill <name>

(later) /reload_skills, /agent, /help

command result types (structured, not freeform)

lily_prompting/

Owns: assembling the LLM call inputs from session state. Contains:

build_messages(session, persona, selected_skill, user_text) -> list[Message]

inject skill body only for the turn (prompt_rewrite)

keep infrastructure out of the prompt (don’t dump snapshot)

lily_runtime/

Owns: the “orchestrator loop” that decides what happens next. Contains:

routing rule: command-path vs conversational-path

“selected_skill” resolution behavior

invokes LLM (or stubs it) and tools (later)

error handling boundaries (no silent fallbacks)

lily_cli/

Owns: user entrypoint. Contains:

lily command

REPL loop (or single-shot mode)

prints command output + assistant output

That’s the V0 package map. Nothing else.

Clean execution flow (V0)

Here’s the deterministic flow with the LLM clearly downstream.

0) Process start

Config resolve (paths, model defaults)

Persona load → PersonaBundle (read files)

Skills load → SkillSnapshot (discover → precedence → eligibility → sorted index)

Session create → Session(active_agent, snapshot, model_config, conversation_state=[])

1) Each user input turn

Input received

If starts with / → command path (NO LLM)

parse command (exact)

execute handler against session snapshot

print deterministic result

(optionally) append to conversation_state as a tool/system event, if you want auditability

done

Else → conversational path (LLM may be used)

runtime chooses at most one skill (or none) using snapshot (probabilistic)

build prompt messages:

persona blocks

(optional) selected skill body injected

conversation_state + new user message

call LLM

append assistant message to conversation_state

done

Key invariant: commands never touch the LLM, and skill availability never re-reads disk mid-session.

Suggested package folder layout text Copy code src/lily/ lily_cli/ lily_runtime/ lily_session/ lily_persona/ lily_skills/ lily_commands/ lily_prompting/

(You can keep a thin lily/__init__.py that exports the public API, but each of those is a real package.)

One concrete “module list” to hand to an implementer

lily_skills.loader.build_snapshot(bundled_dir, workspace_dir, user_dir=None) -> SkillSnapshot

lily_persona.load_persona(root_dir) -> PersonaBundle

lily_session.new_session(persona, snapshot, model_config) -> Session

lily_commands.parse(text) -> Command \| None

lily_commands.dispatch(cmd, session) -> (Session, CommandOutput)

lily_runtime.handle_text(text, session, persona) -> (Session, AssistantOutput)

lily_prompting.build_messages(...) -> list[Message]

If you want, I’ll do the next most useful artifact: a single “kernel diagram” (boxes + arrows) and the exact public interfaces for each package so you can enforce boundaries in reviews.
