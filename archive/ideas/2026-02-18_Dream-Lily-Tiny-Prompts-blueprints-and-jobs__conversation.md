I can’t directly fetch or display a YouTube transcript from that link inside chat — but I can show you the fastest way to get it yourself (takes ~10 seconds). ✅ Option 1 (Best — straight from YouTube) Open the video: https://youtu.be/8kNv3rjQaVA?si=oZYpsO8e1nAtXQWVExpand the video description (“…more”). Scroll down. Click Show transcript. YouTube moved this button into the description area, which is why people often think it’s gone. Reddit+1⚡ Option 2 (If YouTube doesn’t show a transcript) If the creator disabled captions or the UI doesn’t show them, paste the link into one of these: YouTube Transcript Generator (YouTubeNavigator)NoteGPT Transcript ToolTranscript.you extractorThese tools pull captions from YouTube’s caption system (if captions exist). YoutubeNavigator+1⚠️ Important note If the video has no captions at all, no tool can magically retrieve an official transcript — they can only generate AI transcriptions from audio, which may be less accurate. RedditIf you want — easy shortcut 💡 Paste the transcript here after you grab it, and I can: clean it up remove timestamps summarize it extract key ideas or turn it into notes/article format Just drop it in 👍

How do I copy from YouTube transcripts

---

### Assistant

Here’s the clean, no-friction way to copy a YouTube transcript 👍 📄 Method 1 — Directly from YouTube (Desktop or browser) Open the video on YouTube. Click “…more” under the video description. Choose Show transcript. The transcript panel opens on the right. Click inside the transcript. Press: Ctrl + A (Windows) or Cmd + A (Mac) → select all Ctrl + C / Cmd + C → copy Then paste anywhere you want. ✨ Optional tip Click the ⋮ (three dots) in the transcript panel and turn timestamps OFF before copying if you want clean text. 📱 Method 2 — iPhone / Mobile app (what usually works) The YouTube app can be picky, so this is easier: Open the video in Safari (not the app). Tap aA → Request Desktop Website. Open Show transcript. Long-press on the text → Select All → Copy. ⚡ Method 3 — If YouTube won’t let you select text Sometimes the transcript panel blocks selection. Use this workaround: Open transcript. Click anywhere in the text. Ctrl + A / Cmd + A. Copy. Even if it doesn’t look highlighted, it usually copies. 🔥 Pro tip (since you’re doing research workflows) If you’re going to do this often: paste into a plain-text editor first (Notepad, Obsidian, etc.) then clean timestamps or formatting. If you want, I can also show you the fastest “power-user” method that lets you grab transcripts in one click (very useful for your Lily / research workflows).

Perfect — thanks. Two things I can do for you right away: Clean this transcript (remove timestamps / “seconds” noise / obvious mis-hearings like “OpenC cloth”) Turn it into something useful for Lily (a structured spec + sub-agent decomposition) 1) Cleaned transcript (readable, no timestamps) I kept your chapter breaks and fixed the most obvious transcription glitches (OpenC cloth → OpenClaw, “ASA” → Asana where that’s clearly intended, “atclude” → “@Claude/assistant” as “mention trigger”, etc.). If any proper nouns are actually different in the video, tell me and I’ll patch them. Chapter 1: IntroOpenClaw is the most important AI software I have ever used. It has fundamentally changed how not only I work, but I live. It has infiltrated every aspect of my life and allowed me to be hyper-productive everywhere. And yes, I’m still running it on this little Mac

### User

I’m very interested in what he is saying about openclaw and how it relates to Lily

---

### Assistant

Totally. What he’s describing is basically “Lily, but productized as a personal operating system” — and the good news is: it maps cleanly onto the direction you’ve already been steering (Director + smart-tool subagents + contracts + local-first memory). Here’s the tight mapping. The OpenClaw ideas that matter most for Lily 1) Identity + Soul = Lily’s persona system (but per-context) OpenClaw:identity.md + soul.md drive assistant voice + behavior, and it can vary by channel (personal vs Slack). Lily mapping: You already want persona-in-config. Do it per interface context: persona_user (when Lily talks to you directly) persona_workspace (when output is visible to others) persona_tooling (when Lily is writing PRPs / tasks for coding agents) Key design point: persona is not “style.” It’s part of the contract for outputs (tone, verbosity, risk tolerance, assumptions, formatting). 2) Daily notes + distilled prefs + vector search = your memory spec (validated) OpenClaw: writes daily notes, distills prefs to memory, vectorizes everything for retrieval. Lily mapping: exactly your plan: write-first memory + optional vector index. The insight is the two-tier memory: Raw: chronological logs (ground truth, auditable) Distilled: stable preferences + “operational lessons” (small, curated, high signal) Index: vector retrieval over both (but retrieval should cite source chunks) Key design point: memory should update the config only through gated steps (more on that below). 3) “Pipelines” are just skills + schedulers + data collectors Everything he demoed is a pattern: Collectors (Gmail / Calendar / Fathom / X / Analytics) Sanitizers (noise filters, injection scanning) Extractors (contacts, action items, entities) Stores (SQLite + vector column) Triggers (Slack mentions, Telegram drops) Schedulers (cron jobs) Notifiers (Telegram / Slack) Approvals (human-in-the-loop) Lily mapping: This is your skills model. Each pipeline becomes a skill bundle: collect/*sanitize/*extract/*store/*notify/*approve/*audit/*Key design point: Lily shouldn’t “be smart” everywhere. Lily should orchestrate small, well-defined tools with clear I/O schemas. 4) Councils = parallel expert subagents (but they’re tools, not “coworkers”) He runs a business council, security council, and platform council nightly. That’s basically: multiple specialists run in parallel a synthesizer merges results duplicates removed recommendations ranked Lily mapping: This is exactly the Supervisor + Tools pattern. Director (only user-facing) Specialist agents are “smart tools” Synth tool merges outputs Key design point: councils only work when the specialists have strict output schemas. Otherwise the synthesizer becomes a vibes-based blender. 5) Self-improving prompts = your “agent that edits agents” (but with hard gates) He claims it “learns” and “updates prompts” when he rejects an action item. Lily mapping: You can absolutely do self-improvement, but Lily needs guardrails: A proposed change is a PatchPatch must include: reason, diff, test/validation, rollbackPatch must go through an Approval Gate (you, or a deterministic policy) Patch writes to an auditable changelog Key design point: never let “learning” silently mutate behavior. “Self-evolving” must be reviewable evolution. 6) Prompt-injection paranoia = mandatory for Lily (local-first doesn’t mean safe) His best section for you is security layers: treat all external content as malicious summarize, don’t paste verbatim ignore instruction-like markers from untrusted data isolate content and restrict permissions redact secrets deterministically Lily mapping: This becomes a first-class subsystem: untrusted_ingest sandbox prompt_injection_scan (deterministic heuristics + LLM classifier) safe_summary (strip instruction-like text) capability_firewall (no writes to config/skills without approval) Key design point: Lily needs a capability model (what can be read/written/executed) and it must be enforced outside the LLM. 7) Backups and restore = “operational realism” (this is where most agent systems die) He emphasizes encrypted backups, restore scripts, and alerting. Lily mapping: add “ops-grade” defaults early: every artifact Lily produces is written to disk all state is reproducible from .lily/ + backups scheduled backup + restore test Key design point: Lily must be able to “rebuild herself” on a new machine from backups + a bootstrap script. The one big takeaway for Lily’s architecture OpenClaw’s “magic” is not one model. It’s a workflow OS: Director (you-facing)→ selects skill pipeline→ runs collectors / sanitizers / extractors→ stores structured results → runs councils (parallel specialists) → asks for approval when risky → writes memory + updates through gates → schedules it all with cronThat’s Lily. If we translate his video into Lily “Ship Cut” milestones Scheduler + Skill Runner (cron + “run skill X at time Y”) Local DB + Vector index (SQLite + embeddings table) Approval framework (Telegram/CLI prompt approvals, even just terminal prompts first) Council runner (parallel tool-agents + synthesizer) Self-update patch system (propose diff → validate → approve → apply) If you want, I’ll turn this into a Lily design doc section you can drop straight into your repo: “OpenClaw-derived patterns” “What we adopt / what we reject” “Contracts and gates” “Minimum viable council” “Self-evolution protocol” And if you tell me which single workflow you want Lily to do first (CRM? knowledge base? nightly councils? transcript-to-notes?), I’ll decompose it into the exact first subagents + schemas.

### User

So my question really revolves around how little he gives as a prompt. But it seems with Lily it is super heavy to make new skills and agents. Maybe it is just because we haven’t finished her yet. Please look at the images and see some examples of what he did.

---

### Assistant

You’re noticing something very real — and honestly this is one of the big architectural truths hiding underneath that video. What you’re seeing is not that OpenClaw needs less structure than Lily. What you’re seeing is that the structure is hidden. Let’s walk through the images you sent, because they actually expose the trick. 🧠 1) Business Advisory Council — the illusion of a “small prompt” At first glance, the prompt looks tiny: “Build a business analysis system with parallel independent AI experts…” That feels magical — like the system just understands everything. But look closely at what’s actually implied: Hidden assumptions already exist The system already has: Data collectors Scheduler / cron system Agent runtime Parallel execution Memory/database Notification system Approval flow Structured outputs Summarization pipeline That one prompt is not creating a system from nothing. ➡️ It is instantiating patterns that already exist. Translation for Lily:OpenClaw has a big library of implicit primitives. Lily currently asks you to define those explicitly. 🛡️ 2) Security Council — this is actually a fixed architecture 4This diagram reveals the real structure: scss Codebase ↓ Worker (cursor agent CLI) ↓ Specialists (offense / defense / privacy / realism) ↓ Summarizer ↓ Numbered report This is NOT dynamically invented. It’s a reusable architecture template: map step parallel specialist phase reduce/summarize phase delivery adapter That’s basically: LangGraph map → reduce → output So what the user wrote as a short prompt is really: “Instantiate the SecurityCouncilTemplate with these roles.” 🧩 3) Memory System — this matches your design almost perfectly 4This diagram is extremely important for Lily. Look at it carefully: mathematica Conversations → DailyNotes → MEMORY.mdIdentityFiles → NextSessionThis is exactly what you’ve been building: write-first memory distilled preference layer identity/persona injection at session start You are not behind. You are actually designing it more explicitly. The real answer to your question You asked: Why does he give tiny prompts, but Lily feels heavy? Here’s the honest answer: OpenClaw = high abstraction layer It already has: prebuilt patterns implicit defaults opinionated architecture hidden templates You are basically doing: go new Council(type="business") but the UI makes it look like: arduino "Build me a business council"Lily right now = low abstraction layer You are still defining: what is a skill what is an agent contracts schemas loader behavior execution model You are building the engine, not using the engine. The big insight (this is important) OpenClaw is NOT actually more intelligent. It just has: 🔥 Pattern Templates What you are missing in Lily is NOT agents. It’s: Reusable workflow archetypes.What Lily needs next (this is the unlock) Instead of: ❌ “create new agent” ❌ “create new skill” You want: ✅ Workflow Archetype Library Examples: 1️⃣ Council Archetype Input: data sources specialist personas output schema System automatically: spins up parallel agents merges outputs ranks recommendations 2️⃣ Pipeline Archetype Input: collector parser extractor storage target System automatically: creates ingestion workflow. 3️⃣ Memory Archetype Input: source conversation summarization rule distillation policy System automatically: updates memory layers. The huge shift (this is the “aha” moment) Right now you think: Lily is heavy because agents are hard. Actually: Lily feels heavy because you’re operating one level too low. You should be creating: nginx Archetypes → instantiate workflows not: nginx Agents → wire manually What OpenClaw is secretly doing Internally it’s something like: python CouncilTemplate.create(
    specialists=[...],
    data_sources=[...],
    delivery="telegram"
) The prompt is just sugar. How this fits YOUR LangChain v1 direction This matches exactly the direction we discussed: Director supervisor subagents as smart tools contracts + schemas The missing piece: 🧱 Add a “Pattern Layer” above agents. sql User ↓ Director ↓ Pattern Instantiator   ← YOU NEED THIS ↓ Agents + Tools The brutal truth (you’ll like this) You are currently building: OpenClaw v0.1 internally. He is demoing: OpenClaw v3 abstraction layer. You’re not behind — you’re just earlier in the stack. The really exciting part (and this is very you) Once Lily has archetypes, she can: Generate new workflows automatically. Example: You say: “I want a research council for my PhD.” Lily does: selects Council archetype generates specialists automatically wires schemas registers scheduled run That’s when she starts feeling like OpenClaw magic. If you want the next-level insight (I strongly recommend) I can show you the single architectural change that will make Lily suddenly feel 10× lighter to build — and it’s not about agents or prompts. It’s about adding one small layer between skills and execution. And honestly… once you see it, you’ll realize why almost every advanced agent framework converges to it.

Alright — here’s the one architectural change that will make Lily suddenly feel lightweight and “OpenClaw-like”. This is the real secret hiding behind what you just watched. 🌱 The Missing Layer: Workflow BlueprintsRight now Lily likely looks like this: sql User ↓ Director ↓ Agents / Skills ↓ Tools This means every new capability feels like: build agent → define schema → wire tools → add memory → schedule → etc. That’s heavy. What OpenClaw is actually doing It has an invisible layer: r User ↓ Director ↓ 🟣 Blueprint Layer   ← missingin Lily ↓ Agents / Tools The short prompts work because they do NOT create agents. They instantiate a predefined blueprint. 🧩 What is a Blueprint (important distinction) A blueprint is NOT: an agent a skill a prompt It is: A reusable orchestration pattern with slots. Example: Council Blueprint yaml blueprint:councilslots:-specialists-data_sources-synthesizer-output_channelWhen someone writes: “Build a business advisory council…” OpenClaw probably does something like: python instantiate_blueprint("council", config) 🔥 Why this changes everything Without blueprints: Every workflow is custom engineering. With blueprints: New workflows become configuration. That’s why his prompts look tiny. 🧠 The Three Blueprints Lily needs FIRST If you add ONLY these, Lily will instantly feel 10× easier. 1️⃣ Council Blueprint (parallel thinking) This powers: Business advisory Security council Research reviewers Architecture review Experiment analysis Structure: sql collect inputs
      ↓
run N specialists in parallel
      ↓
merge findings
      ↓
rank + dedupe
      ↓
deliver numbered output This maps perfectly to LangGraph map/reduce. 2️⃣ Pipeline Blueprint (automation / ingestion) This powers: CRM ingestion Knowledge base Email triage Meeting action items Structure: pgsql collector → sanitizer → extractor → storage → notifySlots change — architecture stays. 3️⃣ Memory Blueprint (you already basically have this) lua conversation → daily log
       ↓
distillation
       ↓
memory.md
       ↓
session preloadYou’re already aligned here. ⚡ What changes for YOU (major mindset shift) Right now you think: “What agents should Lily have?” Instead think: “What blueprints should Lily know?” Agents become implementation details. 🧬 How Lily should create things in the future Eventually: You say: “Create a PhD research council.” Director does: Detects intent → councilAuto-fills blueprint: specialists = domain experts inputs = papers + notes schedule = nightly Instantiates workflow Done. No manual agent creation. 🧱 What this means for your current architecture You don’t rewrite anything. Add one layer: bash src/lily/
    blueprints/
        council.py
        pipeline.py
        memory.py
Each blueprint: defines required slots defines execution graph auto-generates subagents internally Your existing tools + agents still work. 💥 Why this is REALLY powerful for you specifically Because your long-term vision: Chrona Venture Nova research agents media pipelines All share patterns. You are building an AI operating system. Operating systems run processes — not handcrafted workflows. Blueprints = processes. 🚨 The subtle but massive insight OpenClaw feels magical because: It moved complexity FROM user prompts INTO architecture. That’s exactly where Lily is heading. If you want the next-level leap (and this is where it gets exciting) There’s a second hidden idea in OpenClaw that most people miss — and it explains why it feels like a living system instead of a tool. It’s about how it treats: workflows schedules memory councils as one unified concept. And honestly… this is the thing that will make Lily feel like Jarvis-level instead of “LLM tooling framework.” Say the word and I’ll show you 😄

---

Alright. The next-level leap is this: 🧠 Unify Everything as JobsOpenClaw feels “alive” because it treats skills, councils, pipelines, memory, backups, reviews as the same primitive: a Job that runs on a schedule or trigger, writes artifacts, and can be inspected/replayed.That’s the secret sauce. What you’re seeing in the video (translated) “Business Council nightly” → job“Security council 3:30am” → job“Memory synthesis weekly” → job“Check email every 30 min” → job“Backup hourly” → job“Video idea pipeline on Slack mention” → triggered job“Knowledge base ingest on Telegram drop” → triggered jobSo the system doesn’t feel like “I have 40 skills.” It feels like “I have an operating system with scheduled processes.” 🌱 Lily’s missing primitive: JobSpecYou already have Skill Spec and Session Model. Add one more: ✅ JOB_SPEC_V0.md (concept) A job is: a blueprint instance with bindings (data sources, personas, tools) plus schedule/trigger rules plus delivery rules plus audit + replay hooks Minimal job.yaml shape yaml id:security_councilblueprint:counciltitle:"Nightly Security Council"trigger:type:croncron:"30 3 * * *"inputs:workspace_path:"."scope:-"src/**"-"configs/**"-".lily/**"council:specialists:-name:Offensivefocus:"What could an attacker exploit?"-name:Defensivefocus:"Are protections adequate?"-name:DataPrivacyfocus:"Are sensitive data handled correctly?"-name:OperationalRealismfocus:"Is this practical or security theater?"synthesizer:"summarize_rank_number"output:channel:telegramformat:numbered_findingsseverity_escalation:trueapprovals:required_for:-"auto_apply_patch"-"send_email"-"publish_public"This one file is what makes “small prompts” possible: the prompt just creates a JobSpec using a known blueprint. 🔥 The “living system” effect Once everything is jobs, Lily can: 1) Show you what she does while you sleep list jobs last run status failures logs artifacts produced 2) Be debuggable “Why did you recommend X?” → open job run → show inputs → show specialist outputs → show synthesizer merge. 3) Be safely self-evolving Jobs can propose patches, but patch application is a job output that goes through approval. 🧩 This connects to your Blueprint Layer perfectly Blueprints answer: how do we orchestrate?Jobs answer: when/how often/with what bindings + where do outputs go?So the final stack becomes: bash User ↓ Director ↓ Blueprints  (orchestration patterns) ↓ Jobs        (scheduled/triggered instances) ↓ Agents/Tools ↓ Artifacts + Logs + Memory That’s OpenClaw’s vibe. ✅ The second hidden trick: “Artifacts, not chat” OpenClaw looks lightweight because it outputs to: Telegram digests Slack posts DB rows markdown files diagrams Chat is just the control surface. So Lily should default to producing: .lily/runs/<job_id>/<timestamp>/report.md.lily/runs/<job_id>/<timestamp>/evidence.json.lily/runs/<job_id>/<timestamp>/artifacts/*Then send a short summary to the UI. This is how you get auditability + trust. 🧨 The one rule that makes it safe No job can mutate core behavior without a Patch GateA job may propose modifications (prompts/config/skills), but only a Patch job can apply them after approval. So “self-evolving” becomes: job detects improvement → emits patch_proposal.jsonyou approve → Patch job applies diff restore/rollback is automatic (previous version kept) That’s how you get “wild” without “dangerous.” What I recommend we do next for Lily (no fluff) Ship Cut: “Jobs + Council blueprint” Because it’s the highest leverage and matches what you’re excited about. Deliverables: JOB_SPEC_V0.md (the contract) council blueprint implementation (map/reduce) job runner CLI: lily jobs listlily jobs run <id>lily jobs tail <id>artifact layout under .lily/runs/…minimal notifier stub (terminal output first; Telegram later) Once that exists, you can create new councils with a tiny prompt because the engine is already there. If you want, I’ll write JOB_SPEC_V0.md in the same style as your other contracts (tight, explicit, with canonical examples) and include one canonical job folder you can copy/paste (like you requested for skills).

---

### User

Let me get a gut check on this.

We have several types of primitives of which can be made up of other primitives. If all primitives have the same contract, they can all be treated the same by the director.

I’m currently working on agents and sub agents. Perhaps I put a pause on subagents.

Then I make jobs and then blueprints? Maybe the other way around. I think a job can execute any kind of primitive. If so, since I literally just started agents, I could do jobs and layer primitives as I go.

---

### Assistant

Gut check: yes, your instinct is right — unify around a small set of primitives with a common contract so the Director can treat them uniformly. But there’s one tweak: ✅ Not “all primitives have the same contract” More accurate: All runnable things implement the same Run Contract.They can still declare different I/O schemas, capabilities, and side-effects. That keeps it clean without forcing everything into one awkward shape. Pause subagents? Yes — temporarily.Subagents are an optimization and a specialization mechanism, not the foundation. If you lock in: Run Contract Job system Blueprint instantiation …then subagents naturally become “one way to execute a step” (parallel, background, specialist). So: pause the subagent feature work, keep the concept. Jobs vs Blueprints: do Blueprints first, but tinyYou’re right that “a job can execute any primitive.” That’s exactly why blueprints should exist first: A Blueprint defines what to run (the orchestration graph + required slots). A Job defines when/how often and with what bindings to run it. If you build Jobs first without Blueprints, you’ll end up with “jobs that run ad-hoc scripts,” and you’ll rebuild orchestration later. Minimal plan that avoids thrash Run Contract (R0) — the interface everything executable must implement Blueprints (B0) — start with one blueprint: council (map → reduce) Jobs (J0) — schedule/trigger wrapper around “run blueprint instance” This gets you OpenClaw’s “tiny prompts” fastest. Your “layer primitives as I go” approach is solid Yes: because once you have the Run Contract + blueprint runner, you can keep adding new primitive types without changing Director logic. Think of it like this: Director only needs to know: how to select something runnable how to execute it via Run Contract how to log artifacts + handle approvals Everything else is “plugins.” A concrete primitive taxonomy (simple, composable) Use two categories: 1) RunnableImplements Run Contract: Skill (single action / tool orchestration) BlueprintInstance (workflow) Job (scheduled runnable wrapper) later: Council, Pipeline, etc. are just blueprint instances 2) CallableLow-level tools: Tool (deterministic function) Adapter (Telegram/Slack/DB IO) Collector (data fetch) Director only orchestrates Runnables. The contract you’re aiming at (the key) Every runnable returns the same top-level envelope: status artifacts produced next actions requested (approvals) references (logs, sources) But the payload can vary by runnable type. That’s the trick that makes everything “feel uniform” without being rigid. What I’d do in your shoes (today) Freeze subagentsDefine Run Contract (one page) Implement Blueprint: council (parallel specialists + synthesizer) Implement Job wrapper that can run any runnable (even “run now”) Once that exists, adding subagents is easy: they become an execution strategy for steps inside a blueprint. If you want, I’ll write the Run Contract spec (R0) + the Council blueprint slots (B0) as two tight markdown docs you can drop into your repo immediately, aligned with your existing contract style.

### User

Are blueprints something like a langgraph graph that is dynamically built?

---

### Assistant

Yes — that’s exactly the right mental model 👍 but with one important refinement: A Blueprint is not the graph itself.A Blueprint is a recipe that produces a LangGraph graph when instantiated. Think: mathematica Blueprint  →  GraphBuilder  →  ConcreteLangGraphGraph🧠 The clean mental model Blueprint = Graph Template A blueprint defines: nodes that must exist execution shape (sequence, parallel, reduce, etc.) required slots/config expected input/output contracts But it does not hardcode: specific agents specific tools exact data sources schedules Those get bound later. Job = Blueprint Instance When a job runs: arduino job config ↓ fill blueprint slots ↓ compile graph ↓ execute graph So yes — the LangGraph graph is dynamically built at runtime (or cached). 🔥 Example: Council Blueprint Blueprint definition (conceptually): python CouncilBlueprint:

nodes:
  - specialists (parallel map)
  - synthesizer (reduce)

slots: specialists[] synthesizer input_provider This is NOT yet a graph. At runtime (Job binding) Job supplies: yaml specialists:-offense_agent-defense_agent-privacy_agent-realism_agentsynthesizer:opus_summarizerNow blueprint builds: lua input
            ↓
┌──────── map ─────────┐ offense defense privacy realism └────────────┬─────────┘
               ↓
         synthesizer
               ↓
            outputThat’s the real LangGraph graph.
🧩 Why this matters for Lily If you skip blueprints and build graphs directly: ❌ every workflow is handwired ❌ graph code explodes ❌ no reuse If you use blueprints: ✅ same orchestration reused everywhere ✅ tiny user prompts (“create security council”) ✅ Director only instantiates templates ⚡ The hierarchy (this is the important picture) java Director ↓ Job (runtime bindings) ↓ Blueprint (graph recipe) ↓ LangGraph Graph(compiled execution) ↓ Agents / Tools / Subagents 🧨 BIG insight (most people miss this) Subagents are NOT a layer above graphs. They are just: nodes inside a compiled graph. Which means your earlier instinct is perfect: ✔️ pause subagents because: Once blueprints exist, subagents naturally appear as: nginx parallel node execution strategy instead of a separate architecture problem. 🧱 How simple your first blueprint can be You do NOT need a DSL or complex system. Just: python classBlueprint:
    defbuild_graph(self, bindings) -> Graph:
        ...
That’s it. Start tiny. 🌱 Why OpenClaw feels magical (this is the real reason) He isn’t creating workflows. He’s invoking predefined blueprints via language: “Build a business council” → council blueprint “Build CRM pipeline” → pipeline blueprint “Security review nightly” → council + cron job The LLM just fills bindings. 🚨 The decision point for you (important) You are at the exact fork where most agent systems go one of two ways: Path A (hard mode) build lots of agents first handwire graphs later realize orchestration explosion Path B (clean architecture — you are drifting toward this) build blueprint abstraction early agents become implementation details You are leaning correctly toward Path B. 💥 One more huge insight (and this will click with your brain) Your Blueprint layer is basically: LangGraph as a reusable macro system. You’re not replacing LangGraph. You’re lifting one level above it. If you want, I’ll show you the three blueprint shapes that cover about 90% of advanced agent systems (including Anthropic-style architectures, OpenClaw, and most internal systems). Once you see those three, Lily’s design will snap into place.

---

### User

Yes give me the three in detail and then list out others we will eventually do.

Also give an idea of what a blueprint config file would look like and the format of a defined blueprint. I was thinking we would have the template yaml and the input yaml so it can consistently inject but also have many concrete blueprint invocations.

---

### Assistant

Yep — there are three blueprint shapes that cover ~90% of what OpenClaw is demonstrating and what Lily needs for “tiny prompts.” The 3 core blueprint shapes 1) Council Blueprint (Map → Reduce) Use it for: business advisory council, security review, research peer review, architecture review, “what should I do next?”, nightly digests. Graph shape:Gather context (inputs) Run N specialists in parallel (map) Merge + dedupe + rank (reduce) Emit numbered findings + optional “patch proposals” Key propertiesParallelism is the whole point. Specialists must return structured output (not prose). Synthesizer enforces a single ranked result. Slotsspecialists[] (name, role, toolset, output schema) input_provider (what context they all see) synthesizer (merge policy, ranking policy) delivery (terminal/markdown/telegram/slack) guardrails (capabilities + approval triggers) 2) Pipeline Blueprint (Ingest → Transform → Store → Notify) Use it for: CRM ingestion, meeting-to-action-items, knowledge base ingestion, social media snapshots, backups, “watch folder” automations. Graph shape:Collect items (emails, events, links, files, API responses) Sanitize / filter noise / defend prompt injection Extract structured entities Store in DB/files + index (vector) Notify / enqueue follow-ups Optional human approval step(s) Key propertiesOften runs on a schedule or event trigger. Deterministic sanitizers should run before LLMs touch external content. Pipelines produce durable artifacts and DB writes. Slotscollector (source adapter) filters[] (noise rules, allow/deny patterns) sanitizer (prompt injection defense, redaction) extractors[] (entities, action items, summaries) stores[] (sqlite, files, vector index) notifier (telegram/slack/terminal) approvals (gates for risky actions) 3) Plan → Execute → Verify Blueprint (Iterative loop with gates) Use it for: “build a new workflow,” “refactor prompts,” “implement feature,” “generate PRP,” “do deep research and produce a report,” “self-improving updates.” Graph shape:Plan (produce steps + acceptance criteria) Execute (run steps via tools/agents) Verify (tests, lint, consistency checks, policy checks) If fail → revise plan and retry (bounded) Deliver final artifact + evidence Key propertiesThis is how you get reliable autonomy without chaos. Verification is non-negotiable (or it becomes vibes). Great place to plug in a “Gatekeeper / QA” agent. Slotsplanner (outputs a structured plan) executor (tool runner / coding agent / worker) verifier[] (deterministic checks + LLM critique) retry_policy (max attempts, escalation rules) patch_gate (diffs must be approved before apply) Other blueprints you’ll eventually want Here’s the “next ring” once those three exist: Router / Triage BlueprintClassify an input → choose a blueprint/job/skill → dispatch. (This becomes your Director’s internal helper.) Conversation-to-Artifact BlueprintTurns chats into durable outputs: notes, PRDs, meeting minutes, specs. (Standardizes “write to disk with citations.”) Research Blueprint (Search → Read → Synthesize → Cite)RAG-ish workflow with source ranking, claim tracking, and citations. (Perfect for your PhD + Lily’s doc-gen.) Monitor / Watcher BlueprintPeriodically check conditions → alert only on deltas/anomalies. (Email urgency, backup failure, metric drift.) Diff / Patch BlueprintGiven proposal → generate diff → run tests → request approval → apply → rollback plan. (Your safe self-evolution engine.) Migration / Bootstrap BlueprintRebuild Lily on a new machine: restore backups, verify integrity, rehydrate indexes, validate configs. Data Quality BlueprintSampling, dedupe, schema validation, drift detection, hallucination checks for stored memory. Blueprint config: “template YAML” + “instance YAML” Your idea is solid: two layers. Blueprint Template: defines slots, schemas, graph shape, policies. Blueprint Instance (a.k.a. Job binding): fills slots with concrete agents/tools, schedules, and destinations. A. Blueprint Template YAML (definition) Think of this as “a recipe” and a contract. yaml

    -type:terminal_summaryThis is how you get OpenClaw vibes:
The instance is short. The complexity lives in the template + reusable runners. What a “defined blueprint” looks like in code Keep it minimal: a registry entry + a build_graph(). python
# blueprints/council.py (concept)classCouncilBlueprint:
    id = "council.v1"defbuild_graph(self, bindings, policies):
        """
        bindings.specialists: list[Runnable]
        bindings.synthesizer: Runnable
        bindings.input_provider: Runnable
        """# compile a LangGraph map-reduce graph# input_provider -> parallel specialists -> synthesizer -> output
        ...
        return graph
Important: the blueprint template YAML is the data. The class is the implementation that knows how to compile that shape into LangGraph. Practical recommendation for Lily right now Start with exactly these files: BLUEPRINT_SPEC_V0.md (defines blueprint template schema) JOB_SPEC_V0.md (defines instance schema + triggers) blueprints/council.blueprint.yamlblueprints/pipeline.blueprint.yamlblueprints/pex.blueprint.yaml (plan-execute-verify) jobs/examples/*.job.yamlThen “creating a new thing” becomes: write a 15–30 line job binding. If you want, I’ll draft BLUEPRINT_SPEC_V0.md and JOB_SPEC_V0.md in your contract style plus the three canonical blueprint templates and one example job each (security council, CRM pipeline, PRP generator).

### User

It kind of looks like the template isn’t actually used. It might be redundant

---

### Assistant

You’re not wrong — a separate “template YAML” can be redundant if the blueprint is already defined in code and your job file is validated against code-defined schemas.

So the gut-check answer is:

Template YAML is optional.

You only keep it if it buys you something concrete.

Here’s when it’s redundant vs when it’s genuinely useful.

When blueprint templates are redundant

If you already have:

A blueprint implemented in code (e.g., CouncilBlueprint.build_graph())

A Pydantic schema for CouncilBindings + CouncilInput/Output

Job specs that reference the blueprint id + provide bindings

Validation happens via code

…then a template YAML adds a second source of truth. That’s bad.

In that world, do this instead:

✅ “Code defines blueprint + schema”

blueprints/council.py defines slots & graph build

models.py defines Pydantic schemas

jobs/*.job.yaml provides bindings only

Loader validates job bindings against the Pydantic schema for that blueprint

No template YAML needed.

When template YAML is worth it

It’s worth it if you want one or more of these:

1) Blueprint discovery without importing code

If you want Lily to list and reason about available blueprints data-first (no python import side effects), YAML/JSON manifests help.

2) LLM-friendly introspection + generation

If the Director is going to generate new blueprint instances (jobs) from language, having a compact declarative “slot contract” helps it fill fields correctly.

3) Hot-reload / plugin marketplace

If you want to drop new blueprints in via files without shipping Python code (or with minimal code), manifests become your plugin surface.

4) Multiple “flavors” of the same blueprint

E.g., council.v1 + council.v1.strict_security with different policies and artifact rules, without subclassing a bunch of Python.

The clean compromise I recommend for Lily

Don’t do “template YAML + instance YAML.”

Do one of these two approaches:

Option A (Simplest, most correct): Code-only blueprints

Blueprint slots + schemas live in code

Job YAML references blueprint id and supplies bindings

Validation is code-based

This minimizes redundancy and keeps correctness high.

Option B (If you really want data-driven): Blueprint Manifest (thin)

A manifest is not a template. It’s just metadata + slot hints.

It’s not used for execution truth.

It’s used for discovery + LLM guidance.

Example:

yaml Copy code
# blueprints/council.manifest.yaml
id: council.v1 summary: "Parallel specialists → synthesizer → ranked report" bindings_schema: CouncilBindingsV1 input_schema: CouncilInputV1 output_schema: CouncilOutputV1 slots:
  - name: specialists
    kind: runnable_list
  - name: synthesizer
    kind: runnable

Execution still comes from code. Validation still comes from Pydantic.

Your key insight: Jobs are the real “instances”

Yes: jobs are the concrete invocations. They’re what you create often.

Blueprints are the small set you implement occasionally.

So the most practical setup is:

Blueprints: defined in code (few)

Jobs: defined in YAML (many)

Optional manifests: only if it helps the Director generate job YAML reliably

If you want OpenClaw-style “tiny prompts”

The thing that makes prompts tiny is not template YAML.

It’s this:

A small set of blueprint types exists

Job creation is mostly “fill in bindings”

Defaults cover 80% (delivery, artifacts, policies)

Director can generate the job YAML from the manifest + schema

So you can totally skip template YAML and still get the vibe.

If you tell me which direction you want (A: code-only, or B: code + thin manifest), I’ll give you the exact file layout + the minimal schemas for council, pipeline, and plan-execute-verify so job YAML stays short and consistent.
