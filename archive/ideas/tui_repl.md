You’re probably thinking of **Textual** — that’s the one I most strongly recommend for building a *seriously good*, modern REPL experience in Python.

Let me quickly recap the main contenders and why Textual usually wins for what you’re doing (Lily / agent tooling / rich CLI workflows).

## ⭐ 1. Textual — the “awesome” one I likely meant

### Why it’s a big deal

Textual is basically:

> **React-style apps… but in the terminal.**

You get:

* 🧱 Layout system (panels, columns, docking)
* 🧩 Widgets (inputs, tables, logs, trees, tabs)
* ⚡ Async + event-driven architecture
* 🎨 Styling with CSS-like syntax
* 🪄 Smooth updates + animations
* ⌨️ Keyboard bindings + command palette feel

For your use case (agent orchestration + REPL + observability):

This is *perfect* because you can build:

* REPL input panel
* Streaming model output
* Agent status windows
* Logs + metrics pane
* Tool execution monitor
* Task queue viewer

Basically a **local Studio Control Room** inside the terminal.

### REPL-style architecture in Textual

Instead of a “classic readline loop”, you build:

```
App
 ├── CommandInput widget  (REPL prompt)
 ├── OutputLog widget     (LLM responses)
 ├── AgentPanel           (status/metrics)
 └── Event bus
```

Commands trigger events → events drive agent actions → UI updates automatically.

That aligns *extremely* well with your:

* LangGraph style orchestration
* multi-agent systems
* observability-first design

---

## 🧠 2. prompt_toolkit — classic REPL power

Prompt Toolkit

This is the **engine behind IPython**.

Use this when you want:

* autocomplete
* multiline editing
* syntax highlighting
* history
* vi/emacs modes

If your goal is:

> “super powerful command line REPL but still traditional”

this is the correct choice.

BUT…

It’s not a full UI framework.

You *can* build panels and layouts, but it’s harder and more manual.

## 🔥 3. Typer + Rich (your current ecosystem)

Typer
Rich

You already live here.

Great for:

* command-driven tools
* scripts
* structured CLI workflows

Weak for:

* long-running interactive REPL apps
* live dashboards
* multi-pane interfaces

---

## 🧪 4. The “secret weapon” combo I recommended before

This combo is honestly chef’s-kiss for you:

### ⭐ Textual + prompt_toolkit (inside widgets)

Pattern:

```
Textual UI
    ↓
Command widget uses prompt_toolkit
    ↓
Agent orchestration layer
    ↓
Streaming output widgets
```

You get:

* modern UI framework
* elite REPL behavior
* future-proof architecture

This is very close to how high-end internal AI tooling is starting to look.

## 🧭 What I’d pick for Lily (if we were building today)

Given your goals:

* local-first agent system
* REPL-like interaction
* monitoring agents
* command workflows
* eventual Studio-style control room

I would do:

```
Core shell: Textual
REPL input: prompt_toolkit
Rendering: Rich (Textual uses it internally)
Command surface: Typer commands wrapped as actions
```

That gives you:

➡️ CLI mode
➡️ REPL mode
➡️ Dashboard mode

…all sharing the same backend.

---

## 💥 The mental shift (important)

Don’t think:

> “a REPL with extra UI”

Think:

> **An event-driven TUI that contains a REPL.**

That shift is what unlocks agent orchestration.

---

## 😏 Honest Iris Opinion

Most people building agent systems today still do:

```
print(">>>")
```

and call that a REPL.

If you use **Textual**, you’ll be building something that feels closer to:

* Cursor internal consoles
* OpenAI dev tooling
* advanced ops dashboards

…and it scales cleanly into the “many agents running” future you keep describing.

---

If you want, next I can show you something *very* fun:

🔥 **The “Lily REPL architecture” (10/10 design)** — the pattern that turns a REPL into a live multi-agent command center without becoming spaghetti.

That one tends to click instantly once you see it.
