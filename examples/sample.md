In 1325, the Italian city-states of Modena and Bologna went to war over a wooden bucket.

Yes, a bucket.

According to legend, some Modenese soldiers snuck into Bologna and stole a large oak bucket from a public well—an act Bologna considered so offensive that they demanded it be returned. When Modena refused, the situation escalated. What followed was the **War of the Oaken Bucket**, a real battle in which nearly 2,000 men fought just outside the town of Zappolino.

Despite being vastly outnumbered, Modena crushed Bologna's forces in under a day. They returned home victorious—and proudly displayed the wooden bucket in their town hall, where it allegedly remains to this day.

Historians now view the bucket as a symbol of civic pride, petty vengeance, and the kind of escalation only medieval Italians could pull off with such flair. It remains one of the most absurd pretexts for a war in human history—proving once again that you can’t trust Italians with public utilities during peacetime.
