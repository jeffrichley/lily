# Weekly Status

Purpose: one-page operational snapshot of what is done, in progress, next, and blocked.

Update cadence:
- Update weekly (or when priority materially changes).
- Keep this page concise and decision-relevant.
- Link to execution plans and debt items; do not duplicate details.

## Snapshot

- Week of: `2026-02-17`
- Editor: `@team`

## Done This Week

- [x] Phase 1 docs governance delivered and committed (`41871ac`).
- [x] Canonical map and frontmatter contract established (`docs/README.md`).
- [x] Phase 2 docs consolidation delivered and committed (`b81f851`).
- [x] Phase 3 docs cadence and PR docs-impact workflow delivered.

## In Progress

- [ ] Weekly status cadence follow-through (need two consecutive weekly updates), owner `@team`, target `2026-02-24`.

## Next Up

- [ ] Phase 4 light automation (frontmatter/staleness CI checks).

## Blockers and Risks

- [ ] No active blockers.
- [ ] Risk: stale status updates could reintroduce drift.
  Mitigation: keep this page as the only weekly status source and enforce update cadence.
