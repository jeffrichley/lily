# Later Backlog (Curated)

Purpose: hold lower-priority future ideas that are intentionally not active work.

Status discipline:
- This is not a phase tracker and not a completion checklist.
- If an item becomes active, move it into a plan/debt document first.

Canonical sources:
- Priority direction: `docs/dev/roadmap.md`
- Active debt and cleanup commitments: `docs/dev/debt_tracker.md`
- Memory program status: `docs/dev/memory_execution_plan.md`

## Curated Future Ideas

- Tool discovery/registration so skills can introduce tools without manual runtime wiring.
- Optional user skills root with explicit precedence policy (`workspace > user > bundled`).
- Skill validation command (`skills validate`) with deterministic diagnostics.
- Unknown-command suggestion mode with strict non-executing behavior.
- Replay/trace artifact UX for debugging production incidents.
- Docs index page linking specs, plans, ADRs, and runbooks.
