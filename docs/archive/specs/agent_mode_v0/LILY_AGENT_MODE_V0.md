Phase 1 — Define Lily Agent Mode Scope (1 doc, small)

We create:

LILY_AGENT_MODE_V0.md

It answers:
- What does Lily load?
- How does Lily select skills?
- What is deterministic vs LLM-driven?
- What is persisted per session?
- What is NOT included in V0?

No architecture.
No libraries.
No runtime yet.

Just contracts and boundaries.
